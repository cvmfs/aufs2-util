http://aufs.sf.net
J. R. Okajima

These utilities are always necessary for aufs2.
If you forget to install them, your aufs may not work correctly.

Makefile in this tree has some customizable make-variables.
- KDIR
  specify your kernel source path if necessary
- DESTDIR
  specify your install path if necessary.
  some commands have to be installed under /sbin.

o /sbin/mount.aufs, /sbin/umount.aufs
  Helpers for util-linux-ng package. You should NOT invoke them
  manually. Just install them by "make install".

o /sbin/auplink
  Handles aufs pseudo-link at remount/unmount time. You can invoke it
  manually at anytime.

o /usr/bin/auchk
  Similar to generic fsck. Checks whether a branch is healthy or not
  from aufs's point of view.

o /etc/default/aufs
  A library for shell scripts.
