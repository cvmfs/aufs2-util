Utilities for aufs2
http://aufs.sf.net
J. R. Okajima

These utilities are always necessary for aufs2.
If you forget to install them, your aufs may not work correctly.
And these are not for aufs1 essentially, except aubrsync. See below in
detail.

Makefile in this tree has some customizable make-variables.
- KDIR
  specify your kernel source path if necessary.
  Note: this path should point kernel _source_ path, instead of kernel
  _build_ path. Don't confuse with the path in "make O=<kdir>" when you
  build a kernel in a different dir.
- CPPFLAGS or ARCH
  specify the include path to your aufs2-standalone tree, if necessary.
  the makefile finds the correct ${KDIR}/arch/${ARCH}/include dir and
  sets the include path to CPPFLAGS="-I...". if the login in Makefile is
  poor and doesn't support your build environment, then set the
  variables directly.
- DESTDIR
  specify your install path if necessary.
  some commands have to be installed under /sbin.

o /sbin/mount.aufs, /sbin/umount.aufs
  Helpers for util-linux-ng package. You should NOT invoke them
  manually. Just install them by "make install".

o /sbin/auplink
  Handles aufs pseudo-link at remount/unmount time. You can invoke it
  manually at anytime.

o /usr/bin/auchk
  Similar to generic fsck. Checks whether a branch is healthy or not
  from aufs's point of view.

o /usr/bin/aubrsync
  Move files from the upper writable branch to the lower branch.
  If you use this script with aufs1, then you need to install aufs.shlib
  to /usr/lib/aufs.shlib. Currently only the 20080211 version is tested
  for aufs1.
  The development of this script is sponcered by ASUSTek Computer Inc.
  (http://www.asus.com/).
  Kindly they agreed that I keep my aufs work as free software as it has
  been.

o /etc/default/aufs
  A library for shell scripts.

o /usr/lib/libau.so
  A dynamic link library for "readdir(3) in user-space".
  If you need this , then run "make libau.so install_ulib". And refer to
  the aufs manual in detail.
